  # Sleep
  # -----
  #
  # The system will not stay asleep properly while on battery power or AC in
  # either offload mode or sync mode.  This is true whether TLP is enabled or
  # disabled.  When the system is told to sleep, it will appear to go into a
  # sleep state, but within five minutes (and sometimes much more quickly; in
  # my case especially if a USB hub is connected), it will wake itself.  I
  # attempted to identify what was causing this to happen, but was not
  # successful.  Note that this behavior is different from that of the P50 or
  # P51, both of which can be convinced to sleep by changing TLP config.
  #
  # throttled vs. thermald
  # -----------------------
  #
  # NB: the p53 profile currently uses throttled to prevent too-eager CPU
  # throttling.  I understand throttled to have been a workaround solution at
  # the time the p53 profile was created (throttled's original name was
  # "lenovo_fix").  thermald would have been preferred if it worked at the
  # time.
  #
  # I read
  # https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Carbon_(Gen_6)#Power_management.2FThrottling_issues
  # as saying that thermald is fixed under the circumstance that led to the
  # development of throttled given version 5.12+ of the kernel combined
  # with version 2.4.3+ of thermald.  At the time of this writing, the
  # stable NixOS kernel is 5.15 and 2.4.9 of thermald.
  #
  # In the meantime, I also ran the "s-tui" program which can stress test the
  # system, while eyeing up the core temps and CPU frequency under three
  # scenarios: under thermald, under throttled, and with neither.  None of the
  # scenarios seem to have massively improved fan behavior, core temps, or
  # average CPU frequency than another.  The highest core temp always seems to
  # hover around 90 degrees C, the lowest CPU Ghz around 3.4 on a 3.8Ghz machine.
  #
  # I ended up choosing throttled because subjectively, the fans seem quieter
  # when it's stressed and it allows the average temps to get a degree or two
  # higher when running throttled than when running in the other two scenarios,
  # but still substantially under critical temp.
